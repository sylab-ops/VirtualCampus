# VirtualCampus
The implementation of this project is to create a virtual platform of interaction between the College Staffs and Students. The organogram of college operation system becomes more efficient, accurate & less complex. 
Our project falls under the category of web application programs in which I try to reduce the human efforts in “College Campus” and creating smooth flow of work anytime anywhere using proper authentication. 
The goal of our project is to connect student & college anytime, anywhere all 24/7 and 365 days a year, this is the network of connections only between the administrators, accounts department, students of the institution.
